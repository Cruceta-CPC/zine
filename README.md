# Cruceta's lil' zine of cybersecurity

## Introduction

This zine provides a quick but comprehensive examination of personal cybersecurity practices and procedures.

You can use it to keep yourself safe and protect your privacy online.

## Know your rights

Online safety and privacy are basic human rights. Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, proclaimed by the UN General Assembly on 10 December 1948 in Paris, states the following:

>"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks."

Your human rights are inalienable. No entity, whether individual, corporate, or state, has the authority to infringe upon any individual's online privacy.

## Ways to Protect Yourself from Cyber Threats

While online safety and privacy might be a human right, there are still threats out there.

It’s wise to look closely at what you do online and make sure you’re getting things right.

Here are some things you can do to protect yourself online.

### Use a Password Manager 

Password security is important. You don’t want your accounts to be hacked. For the best security, passwords should be both long and intricate. Password managers, such as [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/), can help by storing and managing complicated passwords.

### Do a Biannual Security Audit

Set a reminder to review your online presence every six months, and remove any potentially compromising content. Content that contains information about your whereabouts, for example, might be a problem.

While the internet offers endless enjoyment, it's easy to accidentally compromise your security. If you find completing an audit tiring, consider turning it into a hang out with your mates. You can all help each other out.

### Be Cautious on Social Media

Social media platforms aren’t just entertaining. They’ve become integral to society. However, they’ve been found to have faltered in maintaining user information security a number of times.

Be cautious. Limit uploading identifiable data, like personal and family photos. You can also consider removing content that you store on social media sites and downloading data backups so you can store it yourself.

For communication, platforms like [Signal](https://signal.org/) & [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) are safer alternatives.

### Prioritize Using Safe Browsers

[Chrome may not prioritize your privacy](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malwaregoogle.en.html). Big tech browsers, like Safari and Edge, require caution as well.

[Brave](https://brave.com/), a Chromium-based browser, is a privacy-respecting alternative.

### Opt for Secure Email Providers

>"If the product is free, you're the product."

This tech saying highlights why using secure email services is vital.

Secure email services don’t sell your data.

Did you know that some email providers scan your emails for keywords so they can show you personalized ads?

Bad faith actors can also purchase this information to more effectively target you.

Consider switching to [Startmail](https://www.startmail.com/) or [Proton](https://proton.me/)

### Implement Ad-Blockers

Ads can be more than just annoying. In fact, some of big tech's most concerning behaviors relate to ads. If you don't use a browser like Brave, consider extensions like Ghostery and uBlock to shield your identity.

Content creators reliant on ads can consider using direct support methods, like tip jars, instead of ads. This helps artists earn without boosting the influence of ad companies.

### Consistently Use VPNs

Using a VPN like [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/) gives you an essential level of online protection.

VPNs encrypt your data, hide your IP address and do a whole lot more.

If online businesses you engage with discourage VPN use, voice your concerns and try to switch to ones that let you prioritize your security.

### Do Digital Clean-Ups

Engage services like [Incogni](https://incogni.com/) to minimize your online footprint.

Repeat this process from time to time as well.

### Defend Against Malware

Use trusted tools like [Kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.com/?ignoreredirects=true) and [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) to safeguard yourself against malware threats.

Regularly review and update your protective software as well.

### Use Privacy-Focused Search Engines

[Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/) allows Google search results without Google's tracking.

[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) is a more well-known alternative.

## Some Things to Think About

We’ll all be more secure if we work together and remember to stay on top of cyber threats.

### Cybersecurity is a Continuous Effort

Staying secure means maintaining an effort.

Cyber threats evolve, and we all need to make sure our cybersecurity practices keep us ahead of the threats. Remember to keep an eye on the advice as it evolves. If it’s easier, you can ask your friends what news they have.

Staying up to date normally only means making occasional basic changes, but it can really help.

In today’s interconnected world, staying cyber secure even protects your loved ones as well!

### Educate the Vulnerable

As we just said, cyber threats evolve continually. Unfortunately, vulnerable people are usually the first ones to fall victim to new threats when they emerge.

Unscrupulous online criminals make them their main target.

We can all help by engaging with vulnerable people, such our elders and our young, to make sure they're informed.

### Share This Information and Engage With Others

Help others by letting them know what they can do to keep themselves safe and protect their privacy.

You're fully encouraged to share, annotate or simply reference this zine in your cybersecurity journey.
