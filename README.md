## Know your rights

Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in Paris on 10 December 1948, states the following:

"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks."

No entity, whether individual, corporate, or state, has the legitimate authority to infringe upon an individual's online privacy.

## Use a password manager

For optimal security, passwords should be both extensive and intricate. A password manager, such as [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/), serves to store and manage these credentials.

## Biannual Security Audit

Set a reminder to review your online presence every six months, removing any potentially compromising content.

While the internet offers endless enjoyment, it's easy to inadvertently compromise one's security. Should you find the review distressing, consider turning it into a group activity, enhancing security alongside friends.

## Social Media Caution

Though entertaining, social media platforms have often faltered in maintaining user information security. Download your data backups from these platforms and consider reducing the content you share.

While it's integral to our society, be cautious. Limit uploading identifiable data, like personal and family photos. For communication, platforms like [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) are safer alternatives.

## Prioritize Safe Browsers

[Chrome may not prioritize your privacy](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-google.en.html). Big tech browsers, like Safari and Edge, require caution as well.

[Brave](https://brave.com/), a Chromium-based browser, is a privacy-respecting alternative.

## Opt for Secure Email Providers

"If the product is free, you're the product." This tech saying highlights why secure email services are vital. Consider switching to [Startmail](https://www.startmail.com/) or [Proton](https://proton.me/)

## Implement Ad-blockers

Ads can be more than just annoying; they've driven some of tech's most concerning behaviors. If you don't use a browser like Brave, consider extensions like Ghostery and uBlock to shield your identity.

For content creators reliant on ads, suggest direct support methods, like tip jars. This helps artists earn without the influence of ad companies.

## Use VPNs Consistently

A VPN, like [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/), serves as an essential layer of online protection. If businesses you engage with discourage VPN use, voice your concerns and seek alternatives that prioritize your security.

## Digital Clean-Up

Engage services like [Incogni](https://incogni.com/) to minimize your online footprint. Consider repeating this process periodically.

## Defend Against Malware

Utilize trusted tools like [Kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.com/?ignoreredirects=true) and [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) to safeguard against malware threats. Regularly review and update your protective software.

## Use Privacy-focused Search Engines

[Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/) allows Google search results without Google's tracking.

## Educate the Vulnerable

Cyber threats evolve continually. Engage with the vulnerable, such as seniors and the very young, to ensure they're informed and protected. They often become prime targets for unscrupulous entities.

## Cybersecurity as a Continuous Effort

While cybersecurity is an ongoing effort, even basic steps can significantly boost your protection and that of your loved ones.
